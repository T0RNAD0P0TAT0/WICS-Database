	Shirley: 
    So what I'm thinking is that after every event, we update each person
    with what event they went to and either insert or update the person into the 
    person table. When they are added into the person table, they would increment 
    their points, fill in the rest of the inforamtion if necessary, and also update
    the event_attendance table.

*/

/*
	other:
    -create procedure to use at the end of every quarter or year to remove people
    who have not gone to a meeting for 2+ years
    -procedure to ensure no duplicates (ie if a person forgets if they signed up or not)
    
    
    other additions:
    -view (or sth) that allows you to see data on the events
		-such as how many people went to an event
